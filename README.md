🌐 Facebook Login Page Clone

A fully responsive clone of the Facebook login page built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This project replicates the design and functionality of the official Facebook login interface, focusing on UI accuracy, responsiveness, and basic client-side form validation.

 Features

 - Responsive Design: Works smoothly on both desktop and mobile devices

 - Modern UI: Closely matches Facebook’s real login page layout and color scheme

Interactive Login Form:

- Email/Phone and Password fields

- “Forgot Password” link

- “Create New Account” button

- “Create a Page” link

- Client-Side Validation: Ensures required fields are filled before submission

 JavaScript Functionality:

- Handles form submission

- Performs basic input validation

- Includes placeholders for real authentication logic

 Technologies Used

- HTML5 – Structure of the webpage

- CSS3 – Styling and responsive layout

- JavaScript (Vanilla JS) – Form validation and interactivity

 How It Works

- Basic client-side validation checks input correctness.

- “Log In” button simulates login submission.

- Additional links redirect to account creation or password recovery (placeholders).
